##### 0.3.0-Alpha
  * Basic and messy but functional build system
  * Easy-cheesy deployment for Openshift (read Openshift section)
  * Minor bug fixes on the server code
##### 0.2.0-Alpha
  * Basic server side functionality, it delivers the single page Ember app
  * Basic passport auth on the server side
  * Testing harness (sounds nicer than suite) for the server side with mocha
  * Basic client side structure
  * ... lots and lots of scaffolding code
